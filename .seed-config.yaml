    Start with the base layer necessary to focus on your project and not on the repository.  
    Licensing, structure, documentation and more boilerplate to get you started from your first commit.
  version: "v0.4.3"

vision:
  type: "community"
  overview: |
    Providing a generic base layer for new open source repositories.
  items:
    - "Default usage on first initialization"
    - "Generic seed/base layer files"
    - "Additions to reposeed only accepted for generic usage"
    - "Specific additions should be added to the files after generation"
  concept: "Reposeed's core concept is to provide a basic selection of useful templates. With the help of a configuration file and a small substitution engine the project generates a seed layer for new open source repositories."
  aim: "Our aim is to provide a sufficient base to built a new open source project on top of. Reducing the burden for maintainers and decreasing the hurdles to get started."
