# Reposeed
Start with the base layer necessary to focus on your project and not on the repository.  
Licensing, structure, documentation and more boilerplate to get you started from your first commit.

## Using Reposeed
Install reposeed via `go get`.
```
go get go.okkur.org/reposeed
```

Create the sample .seed-config.yaml file.
```
mkdir YOUR-PROJECT
cd YOUR-PROJECT
reposeed init
```

Change .seed-config.yaml to your needs and apply any changes.
```
reposeed
```

*Hint: commit any changes you need and stash the rest*
